== How to collect performance data?

* Where to get performance metrics
* What protocol – SNMP, WMI, JMX, JDBC, HTTP
* Which metrics should be collected
* _Collectd_ uses a service name
* _Collectd_ is all about creating RRD files - nothing else!
* Viewing performance graph reports in the WebUI is something else
* _Collectd_ evaluates thresholds

* WebUI renders RRD graph files as PNG on demand
* Graph reports define how the metrics should be presented, e.g. calculation, aggregation, line charts, stacked etc.
* Performance graph reports are built with RRD graph commands
* Graph reports can be found in `snmp-graph.properties.d` and `response-graph.properties`
