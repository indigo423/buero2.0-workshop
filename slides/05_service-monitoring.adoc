== How to monitor a service?

* OpenNMS distinct services to detect a service and to monitor a service
* _Provisiond_ has detectors to get services into monitoring on a specific IP interface
* _Pollerd_ is the component who runs the test, document availability and measures response time
* Configuration for _Pollerd_ is in `poller-configuration.xml`
* The shared knowledge between _Provisiond_ and _Pollerd_ is the `service-name`
